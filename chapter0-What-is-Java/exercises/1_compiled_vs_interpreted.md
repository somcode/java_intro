A `compiled` language is one where the program, once compiled, is expressed in the instructions of the target machine; this machine code is undecipherable by humans. An `interpreted` language is one where the instructions are not directly executed by the target machine, but instead read and executed by some other program (which normally is written in the language of the native machine).
The major advantage of compiled languages over interpreted languages is their execution speed. Because compiled languages are converted directly into machine code, they run significantly faster and more efficiently than interpreted languages, especially considering the complexity of statements in some of the more modern scripting languages which are interpreted.
In contrast to compiled languages, interpreted languages do not require machine code in order to execute the program; instead, interpreters will run through a program line by line and execute each command.
